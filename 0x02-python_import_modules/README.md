All about modules
In Python, modules serve as a means to organize code into reusable and self-contained units. A module is essentially a Python file containing functions, variables, and classes that can be imported into other scripts or modules. This modular approach enhances code organization and readability, as related functionalities can be grouped together. To use a module, you simply import it using the `import` keyword, and then access its elements through the dot notation. Python's extensive Standard Library is a collection of built-in modules that offer a wide range of functionalities. Modules help prevent naming conflicts by providing a namespace for their contents. By adopting a modular structure, developers can create maintainable and scalable codebases, making it easier to collaborate on projects and manage complexity.
